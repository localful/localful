/**
 * Permissions are used to control access to server resources and actions.
 *
 * All permissions have the following format as a convention:
 * 	<resource>:<action> OR <resource>:<action>:<access>
 * For example:
 * 	changes:create
 * 		- 'changes' is the resource
 * 		- 'create' is the action (could be any CRUD actions)
 * 		- there is no 'access' present, so this scope only grants permission to a users own changes.
 * 	changes:delete:all
 * 		- 'users' is the resource
 * 		- 'delete' is the action
 * 		- 'all' signifies that this scope grants permissions to the changes of any user.
